- Utilized the SOTA ViT model on the Oxford5k benchmark dataset to generate database embeddings, subsequently compared with the query embedding to ascertain the top-k most comparable images
- Created VM instances on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and connected to the virtual machine via SSH. Utilized the Gradio library to construct the interactive interface and present the outcome
